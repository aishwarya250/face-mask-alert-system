# face-mask-alert-system

Face Mask Detection system built with OpenCV, Keras/TensorFlow using Deep Learning and Computer Vision concepts in order to detect face masks in static images as well as in real-time video streams.If the person captured without wearing mask he will captured and send alerts to the concerned authorities via email and denies access to that person. 

This system can therefore be used in real-time applications which require face-mask detection for safety purposes due to the outbreak of Covid-19. This project can also be integrated with embedded systems for application in airports, railway stations, offices, schools, hotels and public places to ensure that public safety guidelines are followed.
